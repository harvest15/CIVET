Text:
Fourteen people were killed in Orientale Province, DRC [eastern DRCongo]. Armed men entered a bar in Aru town to celebrate a birthday and the qualification of DRCongo for the semi-finals of the African Cup of Nations tournament.

They then asked those who were in the bar to give out their phones and then killed those who refused to comply with this demand. Among those killed was a police officer, two army soldiers and an executive of MONUSCO (UN Security Mission in Congo).

Authorities say this was a case of settling scores and that the shooting was done by an armed group that came from Uganda. But another source says that a similar attack occurred 100 km away in Bunia.
