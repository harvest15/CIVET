Suspected anti-government protesters threw a petrol bomb at a bus full of sleeping passengers in Bangladesh Tuesday, leaving seven people dead and several others fighting for life as deadly political unrest deepens.

Police said the bus was attacked near the eastern town of Chuddogram. The deaths brought the number of people killed in protests unleashed by opposition leader Khaleda Zia last month to 53, with hundreds more injured -- most in firebombings of buses, lorries and cars.

"Seven passengers were burnt to death in the bus after the petrol bomb was thrown at 4am (2000 GMT Monday)," district police chief Tuttul Chakrabarty told AFP by phone.
