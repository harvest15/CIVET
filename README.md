Source code for CIVET: Contentious Incident Variable Entry Template

This is the source code repository for a prototype of the CIVET---Contentious Incident Variable Entry Template---customizable data entry system. CIVET  is being developed by the NSF-sponsored project titled "A Method for Leveraging Public Information Sources for Social Science Research" which is creating tools to improve the efficiency of data generation in the social sciences. The project has an initial focus on coding event data in the domain of contentious politics, but we expect that these tools will be relevant in a number of data-generation domains.

The core objective of CIVET  is to provide a reasonably simple---yes, simple---set of commands that will allow a user to set up a web-based coding environment without the need to master the likes of HTML, CSS and Javascript. As currently implemented, the system is  a rather ugly prototype and primarily a testbed of testing the functionality of some of various elements we expect to have in the final system; it will also be evolving as we add additional elements. Nonetheless, the template-based system should now be useable for coding.

CIVET is written using the Flask "microframework"---http://flask.pocoo.org/---a Python-based system which is widely available on various cloud platforms. The prototype is currently deployed in the cloud on the "Google App Engine"; we currently expect the operational version will be deployed on a University of North Carolina server.

Documentation can be found in the PDF document static/CIVET.Documentation.pdf or downloaded from the working version.
